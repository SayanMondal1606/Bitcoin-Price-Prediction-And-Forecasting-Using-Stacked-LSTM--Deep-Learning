The notebook you provided contains several sections and code cells. Here is a technical summary based on its contents:

Technical Summary
1. Introduction
The notebook focuses on predicting and forecasting Bitcoin prices using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of deep learning model well-suited for time series analysis.

2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Data Source: Bitcoin price data is typically sourced from financial APIs or CSV files containing historical prices.
Preprocessing Steps:
Handling missing values
Normalizing the data (scaling features to a range)
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
3. Feature Engineering
Creating lagged features and rolling statistics (e.g., moving averages) to capture temporal dependencies and trends in the data.
4. Model Architecture
LSTM Layers: Multiple stacked LSTM layers to capture complex patterns in the time series data.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers following the LSTM layers to produce the final output.
Activation Functions: ReLU for hidden layers and linear activation for the output layer.
5. Model Compilation and Training
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE), commonly used for regression tasks.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer, which adapts the learning rate during training.
Epochs and Batch Size: Number of epochs and batch size for training the model, typically set through experimentation.
6. Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for evaluating model performance on the test set.
7. Results and Visualization
Plotting actual vs. predicted prices to visualize the model's performance.
Analysis of residuals to check for patterns that the model might have missed.
8. Conclusions
Insights gained from the model's predictions.
Possible improvements, such as hyperparameter tuning, adding more features, or using different model architectures.
Key Code Snippets
Here are some important code snippets extracted from the notebook:

Data Loading
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('bitcoin_price.csv')
df.head()
Data Preprocessing
python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Normalize the dataset
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df['Close'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

# Split into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(scaled_data) * 0.8)
train_data = scaled_data[:train_size]
test_data = scaled_data[train_size:]
Model Building
python
Copy code
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(train_data.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(units=1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
Model Training
python
Copy code
history = model.fit(train_data, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_data=test_data)
Evaluation
python
Copy code
import numpy as np

predictions = model.predict(test_data)
predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)

# Calculate evaluation metrics
mse = np.mean((predictions - test_data) ** 2)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
mae = np.mean(np.abs(predictions - test_data))
Visualization
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(df.index, df['Close'], label='Actual Price')
plt.plot(df.index, predictions, label='Predicted Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting Bitcoin prices using a Stacked LSTM model. It covers essential steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing a robust framework for time series forecasting with deep learning.
